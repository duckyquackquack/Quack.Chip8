Make a working version first, don't bother yourself about getting it perfectly following best practices
After it works, refactor to look nicer/better 
Add optimizations if needed
Add other nice features
	take screenshot
	show other info such as registers/PC/etc. current values
	any other debug info that could be nice
	support for all common fonts
	save states
	rewind?!
	allow to change the two colours used in the display
	config to allow users to switch between how some opcodes etc work due to ambigious documentation
	make the beep pitch configurable
	allow to configure via either CLI or json config file (if no args passed in cli, will default to some DefaultConfig.json)

Use the command pattern for key presses so they can be mapped to any key (configurable in the json file)

copy a bunch of stuff from this! - https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/EAOaIjYXYAEttlZ.mp4
	- maybe also a section when it shows the prev X frames (not too many though!)
	 - (it's "ImGui")

exception handling

unit tests

make the GUI like this - https://i.redd.it/wzkwwvqbrsy41.png 
one window for the game and one window for all the debug stuff

see the Fish n Chips emulator source code for some cool stuff like rewind

Extend to also include superchip8 and chip48

Add in some benchmarking so we have some numbers to compare to when we make a rust version of it
