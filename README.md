# Quack.Chip8
 A babby's first attempt at emulation - Chip8 in C#
 
It all began when I randomly decided one day that I needed to start writing emulators, presumably out of sheer boredom. Legend has it that a Chip-8 interpreter was the best starting point and so here we are. 
 

## Big Note
This really is my first "emulator" so even though it mostly works, there's a large number of improvements I want to make to the code, both the general structure of it and also some nice extra functionality that comes as standard with most emulators nowadays such as save states. I had no idea what the code would look like in the end and so there were numerous design decisions and refactorings that I wish I hadn't done. They'll get fixed eventually.

## Also...
Audio doesn't work yet!
